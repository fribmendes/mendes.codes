I always wanted to do a screencast. I was also always afraid to do it.

That being said, it’s called Beware of the Software and the first episode is
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LELH5ohH2Vo):

You can [find the code for it
here](https://github.com/frm/beware_of_the_software).

The screencast is going to be about… uh… computer stuff, let’s call it that. I
can’t promise you it will always be about Elixir or distributed systems. But at
least the next batch of episodes will be precisely on that. Distributed systems
with Elixir. From there, I’m thinking about going through some CS papers. I also
take suggestions if you’re willing to give them.

I’m still learning and experimenting with the format so it is far from
perfect... Or maybe even "good". But you can help me make it good.

I’m asking everyone for feedback. Drastically reducing the number of minutes,
showing myself while coding, increasing the font size, tips for the mic and
voice. Help has been invaluable. [Hit me up on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/justmnds) with all you have. Rip me a new one if
you must, but all feedback is appreciated.

Hope you enjoy!
hack the gibson and all that.
