About two years ago [I did the first episode of a screencast][first-episode]
called Beware of the Software.

A couple of days later, I was completely burned out with all that was happening
in my life. Ever since that day, the screencast was on a pile of "things to
handle later".

Two years onward, I feel confident enough to handle some of those things again.
[The second episode is here][youtube]. It brings closure on the first, going through
testing patterns to use with message passing processes.

The source code is available [here][repo].

Going forward, I have some topics in mind. Behind the scenes of Gen Servers
and other OTP constructs, Distributed Systems basics (Lamport clocks, version
vectors, vector clocks, CRDTs, etc), maybe some computational topics like Turing
machines or even exploring CS papers. I’m taking suggestions if you’re willing
to give them.

I’m asking everyone for feedback. Whether it is on my keyboard being too loud,
asking specific questions about the episode or suggesting topics for episodes
ahead. I created a [repo for community questions and suggestions][community-repo],
in order to keep the main repo clean. Help and feedback is invaluable. Hit me
with all you have.

I really hope you enjoy!

Remember to keep your mental health in check, folks.

Cheerios,
