  description: "What happens when you don't like centralized things? You do P2P! I created a distributed smart office using Elixir that runs in a single P2P network. I will use the office as an example and teach you how different the reasoning between a web-like centralised context and a P2P distributed system is. We will go from simple P2P topologies (gossip, trees) to more complex ones (Gnutella2, HyParView, Plumtrees) and take a look at what CRDTs are and how awesome they can be for shared data."

  description: "Ever wondered how companies like Medium and Quora know what you have read without even querying the database? How Facebook does type-ahead queries? Or how databases optimize disk lookup? They use very, very old trick - almost 50 years old. This talk will cover the basics behind bloom filters. It will explain they are so widely used, especially when performance and space-efficiency is required. We will go on a journey through bloom filter land, analysing their behaviour, how different properties affect their internal performance and how you can improve your application by using a bloom filter."
